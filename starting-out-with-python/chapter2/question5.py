# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate
# can be calculated with the following formula: Distance = Speed X Time

DISTANCE_PER_HOUR = 70

print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours:", (DISTANCE_PER_HOUR * 6), "km")
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours:", (DISTANCE_PER_HOUR * 10), "km")
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours:", (DISTANCE_PER_HOUR * 15), "km")
